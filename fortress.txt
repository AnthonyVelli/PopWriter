Stay away from me!
You stink of dead bodies.
Stop it! We both smell of corpses.
And it's all your fault!
Your smell makes me want to vomit.
Though shitworms can't smell shit.
What?
You're a shitworm. You make me sick.
And you said we'd make a fortune if we went to the war.
What's so funny, you idiot?
It's all funny!
First, we arrived late to the war.
Then they mistook us for the defeated side
and forced us to bury the dead.
We finally escaped,
and now it's been two days that we've only had water.
But the funniest thing is your stupid crybaby face.
Let's go home.
Don't you have any pride?
We've even been stripped of the arms we sold our homes for.
We can't go home like this.
Then take it off this dead guy.
Even if I'm desperate, I'm not a thief.
Do what you want. I'm going!
Go. I'll come home after I make a buck.
Don't come crying to me then.
Get caught again and be a gravedigger.
Fool! Go away!
It'll be a blessing to see you go,
you shitworm!
We can't cross the border from this road.
It's a Yamana checkpoint.
Not even a mouse could pass through those barricades.
If they find us, we're dead.
What now?
Unless a fog rolls in, we can't move.
What does it say up there?
It's a notice about a reward for pieces of gold.
Read it to me.
Wanted.
Princess Yuki of Akizuki.
A reward of ten <ryo for her capture.
Three <ryo
for information as to her whereabouts.
By order of the Lord of Yamana.”
Move! Walk!
What are you doing? Move!
Walk!
He's running away!- Get him!
I'm not one of them.
I'm thankful for the fog, but I can't see anything.
Which way is Hayakawa?
Shut up and follow me!
What was that?
Who goes there?
Not grave digging again.
Keep walking!
Hey, it's Matashichi!
Matashichi!
Damn you!
Walk!
Listen!
There is kan of pure gold hidden in this castle.
Until you find it, you're no longer men but moles!
So dig! Dig until you drop, moles!
Matashichi, this is hell!
It's the end!
If we're going to die, let's die together.
That way!
Thieves! Rice thieves!
What shall we do now?
Find the princess.
The princess?
The sole survivor of the Akizuki clan.
I think the reward on her head is ryo.
Ten pieces of gold?
Informers get three.
Three pieces of gold?
It's no good. That's only a dream.
If we get greedy and get caught, we're done for.
I guess we'd better go home.
But how will we cross the border?
Bang and we're dead.
Let's eat.
I can't think on an empty stomach.
Not ready.
These don't burn at all.
What's this?
Why. it's gold!
You're right! it's gold!
But...
a piece of gold inside a stick?
I've heard of a rich man hiding gold in the pillars of his home, but...
What's this? An insignia!
Looks like a crescent.
The crescent is the Akizuki crest!
That's the reserve gold they were digging for in the castle.
Tahei, you made the fire. Where did you get the wood?
Let's split up and look.
I'll go this way. You go over there to the marsh.
Hey, Tahei!
The same piece!
What are you doing?
One's mine!
I found both!
I found the stick first. - I threw it!
I picked up the gold!
Liar! I'm the one who noticed it was gold.
Shh!
Let's go back.
Back?
There must be more.
If someone else notices it, we're done for.
He's following us.
Watch out. Maybe he's a bandit.
He's not a bandit. He has no sword.
You can't be sure. He may work for one.
He stopped following us.
Let's go back.
No, better be careful.
It's late, anyway. It won't hurt to wait one night.
It's a big job. Better safe than sorry.
We haven't seen that guy since, so maybe we didn't need to worry.
Probably a lumberjack or a charcoal maker.
So, let's get this straight now.
What?
Don't play dumb. How to split up the gold.
Let's be fair and divide it equally.
You don't like it?
But I...- Then it's settled! All right?
Let's sleep.
Sleep tight, and let's dream of mountains of gold.
Hey!
Good eve -
Hey!
Cold, isn't it?
What are you doing here in the mountains?
How about you?
Us?
We intend to cross the border.
The border?
We want to go to Hayakawa. - Hayakawa?
But beyond the mountains it's Yamana.
Yes... but you see...
to go to Hayakawa...
This is Hayakawa.
And this is
Akizuki where we are now.
This is...
Yamana.
We want to go from Akizuki to Hayakawa.
But the border is guarded by Yamana soldiers.
So...
we'll cross first to Yamana
and then slip into Hayakawa.
See...
there's no way that survivors of the Akizuki clan
would go to Yamana, the enemy territory.
So the border between Akizuki and Yamana
should be open.
That's right.
The Hayakawa-Yamana border must be easier to cross
than the Akizuki-Hayakawa border.
Anyway, we're just peasants.
Even if anything happened, we'd still make it.
All right. I've made up my mind.
Going through Yamana is a good idea.
The gold pieces are useless here,
but with three men and three horses, we can carry it out.
gold pieces? What are you talking about?
Be honest.
I've got an eye on that place.
Don't kick the stones.
You stop grabbing my leg.
What now?
What's he doing?
He's not here.
Where did he go?
That guy can't be trusted.
What is this place?
It's what they call a hidden fortress.
A hidden fortress? The Akizuki one?
Look. You can see all of Yamana.
But...
for a fortress, it's strangely empty.
Someone's there!
What are you doing?
Oh, it's that guy.
Hey! Come down quickly!
How did you get down here?
What are your names?
I'm Matashichi.
I'm Tahei.
Matashichi, put the rice down.
Tahei, you put the rice in the pot.
Hurry UP!
Where's the water?
I need a drink before the food.
Me too. I can't even spit anymore.
Hey! What's your name?
Me?
I'm Rokurota Makabe.
Rokurota Makabe? I've heard that name before.
Makabe...
Rokurota Makabe...
Get out of here!
Rokurota Makabe is a legendary Akizuki samurai general.
You take us for fools.
We shouldn't put up with this.
Hey!
Stop fooling around. You're no general. You're just a bully.
What's with the big attitude?
Don't make fun of us!
Damn you!
What?
That wasn't very nice.
You could have told us there was a secret passageway.
We've been partners since last night.
Besides, just because you found this place first
doesn't mean you're the boss.
Let's decide now how we're going to divvy it up.
Fair and square, we share it in three equal parts. Deal?
There's the water.
Tastes great!
Excellent.
This is some fortress, with water like this.
What the hell?
Don't bother.
I already went through there. Just prepare the rice.
Shut up! I can't take it anymore! You can stuff your orders!
You want to fight?
Don't hold back! Do him in!
Cook the rice.
It's a girl!
Where is she? Who is she?
I don't know.
She's really quick, though. She's already gone.
Look. She's mine, okay? I'll kill you if you go near her.
Cook, and then it's work.
What are you waiting for?
Don't touch me, fool! It's uncomfortable enough.
It's your face that makes me uncomfortable.
Leave my face alone.
I hate the way you blink all the time.
There you go again.
Shut up!
Put your filthy teeth away.
Show them to me once more and I'll bash them in.
I'm quitting! This is idiotic! I dig and dig and nothing!
It's his fault.
Damn it! Gone again!
He's on his high horse watching us do all the work.
Right. He's probably running around looking for that girl.
Maybe he already found a place and is sleeping with her.
We agreed to split everything in three. The girl should be the same.
That bully isn't just anyone.
I can't figure out what he's up to.
He may already have found the pieces of gold and moved them.
That's very likely. I'm sure of it.
That means he's hiding the gold right now.
So if he's not in this fortress...
Look! There's something suspicious about that spring.
Pretending like he's already checked it out! Damn!
Where do you live?
Hey, lady, don't be mad.
Damn it!
You...
Wait!
What are you doing?
Shut up!
I told you I'd kill you if you touched her!
Wait, boss. it's not fair.
Look.
The girl dropped this.
Don't go behind our back. She's worth ryo.
This does not belong to a mountain girl.
Maybe you think she's the Akizuki princess?
You're right.
That comb does belong to Princess Yuki.
But now it belongs to me. Give it back.
I took it from the princess and gave it to her.
What? - I don't lie.
Then where is Princess Yuki?
I captured her and handed her over to the Yamana authorities.
Careful. I think he's full of crap.
Here's the reward of ryo. Still think it's a lie?
Tell me! Where did Matashichi go?
I don't know!
What are you plotting? Tell me!
To the town.
The town? To do what?
He went to report.
Report who?
The princess, of course. - The princess?
We're not as stupid as you think.
You thought you had us fooled, but we're not that gullible.
I know your game.
The ten gold coins you promised as a reward
are just part of the hidden gold you've got stashed away.
You're greedy on top of it.
You want to capture the princess yourself so you can have all the reward.
It won't go so smoothly.
I made a mistake by relying on scum.
You think you're better, scum?
Matashichi, did you see the officers?
Fool! Do you think I'd be back so soon?
It's the talk of the town already.
The princess was captured a while back, and she was beheaded yesterday.
Boss, we're sorry we doubted you.
It's Rokurota Makabe.
Welcome back.
Any news?
Kofuyu served her duty.
The enemy will relax their guard now.
Now is our chance to escape.
What happened to Kofuyu?
As a dutiful servant, my sister went in place of your Highness.
This assures the safety of your Highness.
Rokurota!
Fool! - What are you saying, your Highness?
Kofuyu was I am What difference is there in our souls?
It is our duty as servants.
Kofuyu was honored...
Lies!
If I were Kofuyu, I would curse this princess.
Your words are too harsh. Rokurota is in an awkward position.
Be quiet!
I don't even want to see your face!
Your nobility doesn't let you shed a tear...
even when you've killed your sister.
Princess!
I hate it!
I hate it!
I don't know what to do with her Highness.
It's the lord's fault.
Even if he was lacking an heir,
it was cruel to raise her Highness like a boy.
Say right and she'll go left, say left and she'll go right.
And though she is a girl,
she has never shown me a tear.
The same with her present behavior.
Insensitive to your pain of having sacrificed your sister,
she herself doesn't shed a tear, but she still criticizes you.
It's too much.
Her Highness is the real sacrifice.
Her suffering is having to rebuild the Akizuki clan.
The Yamana soldiers are here!
There are horses at the spring.
This is good.
To fool the Yamana by going through enemy lines.
This was the peasants' idea.
Depending on their answers, I was ready to kill them.
But hearing their plan to go through Yamana to Hayakawa,
I was stunned.
Sometimes even moss can be smart.
How long can we rely on them?
We can rely on their greed.
Make them carry gold and they'll put up with anything.
That takes care of the gold.
But we cannot take a chance with the princess.
But staying here isn't safe either.
This hidden fortress will soon be discovered by the Yamana too.
And our deal with Lord Hayakawa may not last either.
Understood.
But what shall we do with the princess?
We can disguise her looks, but not her class.
And her speech...
Her Highness will have to be a mute.
A mute?
Isn't there any other way?
There isn't.
I don't know if the princess would agree.
Leave it to me.
I hadn't ridden in a long time.
She runs fast. She's too good to be a packhorse.
Just in case you need to ride.
So we finally pass through enemy lines.
Speaking of which, could you play mute?
Mute?
I'm sure you couldn't do it.
To go through Yamana, my greatest concern is your speech.
We were discussing how you could be mute,
but I think it's impossible.
I was captured once and had to pretend to be a mute.
It was agony.
Your Highness couldn't take it.
I'm not biting.
When you say right, I say left.
I'm a handful.
Very well.
Let me use reverse psychology.
Princess.
Just like you.
All right. This once I will let you fool me.
Otherwise your plan will be foiled.
Princess!
Your noble face again.
If you need anything, tell me now.
Once I'm a mute, I'm not talking until Hayakawa.
We have to tell him.
The bully? Never mind him.
Idiot, be quiet! We'll get caught!
You too!
Where are you going?
Boss, run! The Yamana soldiers have found us.
There were horses
by the spring.
Idiots. I stole those.
We can't carry pieces of gold without them.
Gold?
We'll climb down today.
Where's the gold?
Hey, where's the gold?
Hey, where's the gold?
Don't hold out on us. Come on.
I knew it!
Don't fool around with us.
You said you had already gone through there.
Why did you make us dig at the fortress?
I was testing you.
We'll need a lot of backbone on the road. You did well.
Lift the gold out of the water and onto the horses.
The three of us will carry the rest.
Gold!
Leave the gold in the wood.
Hey, Tahei!
Damn it!
Where did you hide this?
You're so suspicious. That's just firewood.
It's a bad idea to take the girl. She'll slow us down.
What if she blabs?
She's mute. Don't worry. - Mute?
Stop!
This will be an easy border to cross.
Wait.
Better be cautious.
Don't move till I come back.
If we want to get rid of him, now's our chance.
Don't worry. She's mute.
She's mute but she can hear.
Stupid.
A mute can't speak because she's deaf.
This is where we have to think.
He's sly, so we can't trust him even if we cross into Hayakawa.
He'll cheat us.
Let's run away.
What about his load?
We can't carry it.
We'll take his horse.
There's no time to argue.
Let's tell her we're taking the horses for a drink.
Fool! They're not drinking sake.
Hurry!
What are you doing?
Where are the horses?
What shall we do?
Princess!
Princess!
It's frustrating to be a mute. All I can do is watch.
The two of them?
Out of greed, they took the horses.
Then the enemy spotted them. Fine allies.
You!
We can't cross that river.
There's a firing squad on the other side.
I know your game!
Take the gold and get lost!
He's gone.
He's not here.
Boss!
Where are you, boss?
There he is.
Boss, the other side is lined with Yamana soldiers.
What would you do?
What do I care?
What are you doing?
Wait and see at the fortress?
Shut up! Go away!
Please, take us with you.
We promise to behave.
What's that?
The Yamana found it!
What will we do?
We're leaving.
Which way?
Straight ahead.
You're joking!
Leave it to me. I have a plan.
Your pass?
Your pass!
Wait!
Boss!
Next!
Your pass.
What's your problem?
I picked up something.
What? it's just a piece of wood.
I found it at Mt. Suribachi.
He found this.
Gold!
The Akizuki crest!
You really found it at Mt. Suribachi?
Bring me my horse!
That gold is mine. Give it back.- No.
Give me the gold or a reward.
Shut up.
Get lost.
Give me a reward. I won't move!
You bastard!
A reward! Give me a reward!
A reward!
Greedy!
Two or three loaded horses, several men and a girl.
If you see such a group, arrest them immediately.
There are signs that Princess Yuki's party has been here.
But she was beheaded.
Using a double is nothing new.
You also saw the smoke rise on the mountain.
That was Akizuki's hidden fortress.
It was guarded by an old soldier and two others.
They could have escaped.
Instead, they burned the fortress and fought to the end.
It appears they wanted to signal and gain time for others to escape.
The princess and a few men escaped with the gold for sure.
There are traces on the road.
Don't slack off. Catch them and you will be rewarded.
Boss.
Are you okay, boss?
Let's take a back road.
Stop sneaking around. It invites suspicion.
But...
What are you doing?
We're staying here tonight.
Here?
You've got to be kidding me. Let's hurry through the night.
It's a long way. Let's not push it.
Then let's camp out.
Hide a stone among stones and a man among men.
Where will we hide the gold?
Leave it out in the open.
You're so slow!
Pay attention and bring some water!
Always crying, but you refuse to take johns.
You were a lousy deal.
Where did you get her?
In Akizuki.
Lose a war and plenty of women go on sale.
How much?
Five silver pieces. Want her?
Idiot! I'm not a dog like you!
You're bluffing.
No, sorry.
Look here.
Look.
Average-looking, but excellent body.
How about it?
For one silver piece, she's yours for the night.
What's the use of buying a woman who won't take customers?
How much is she?
She's a looker!
She's not one of yours?
I'll buy her. Who does she belong to?
Whose girl is she?
I'll buy her! I'll buy her for a piece of gold!
Enough!
She's a mute.- Mute?
That's too bad. I'll pass.
Who owns the horse outside?
Is it yours?
Do you want to sell her to me? I'll give you whatever you want.
But my load...
She's too good for a packhorse.
Five silver pieces.
You can buy five horses.
Boss, what shall we do?
Two horses aren't enough for everything.
It's hard to find another one.
Damn, this really stinks!
There's no time for girls.
Buy that girl back.
I cannot.
Why not? I am the Princess of Akizuki.
I can't bear to see one of our own in trouble.
No, you're the one in trouble.
Your kindness will be your downfall.
I don't care.
Buy her back.
No!
You cannot make my heart mute too!
A cart was a bad idea.
We're the horses now.
And we've even taken in that girl.
Stop following us. Go away.
Go back to Akizuki.
Don't stop! Keep going!
Have you seen four people, three horses and a girl?
If you do, report them immediately.
It went well. We're lucky.
Who said a cart was a bad idea?
You were grumbling about the girl.
But those men are stupid. Why not check the wood?
What shall we do now?
Keep calm!
Put it down!
Report them!
Run! Wait on the hill!
Damn you!
Why, if it isn't Rokurota Makabe!
Hey, Hyoe Tadokoro!
Stand aside! You're no match for him!
A rare meeting.
I regret not meeting you on the battlefield this time around.
I regret it too.
How about a duel?
With pleasure!
With what? A spear?
Sounds good.
All of them are inferior, but choose one.
I lost!
Wait!
We will meet again.
Rokurota!
Rokurota!
Firewood? What about firewood?
Apparently there's gold hidden in the wood.
They're hiding here with all that.
Four of them. One girl with three men.
She's Princess Yuki from Akizuki.
The reward is pieces of gold for her.
Five pieces just for information.
Don't jump the gun. It won't be easy.
A strong general, Rokurota Makabe, is with her.
It's cold!
It's been three days now.
More rain. More rain.- What?
We can't move even if it stops.
We go out there and we'll get beheaded.
You madman! Are you glad to be beheaded?
Why not?
It's better than putting up with this!
Then give up the gold and get lost.
Good idea.
I'm leaving.
But I'm taking all I can carry.
I'll be set for life.
I'm leaving too.
Great.
What's left is all mine.
Take what you want and beat it.
But we're not getting anywhere.
Where are you going?
I'm going to find something to put the gold in.
Whoever draws the shorter one disappears for a while.
He's late.
I'm sure he'll be back soon.
What's going on? Everyone's carrying wood.
I know! It's the Fire Festival.
Haven't you heard of the Yamana Fire Festival,
where the villagers dance around a bonfire?
We lucked out!
They're going in our direction. If we join the crowd...
I don't get it.
Why do we have to patrol a Fire Festival?
Look. There's a lot of wood at the festival.
The Akizuki clan may hide here with their gold hidden in firewood.
What's this?
What's wrong?- We'll push together.
There's too much wood to check.
We'll inspect the suspicious ones...
who stray from the crowd.
Where is everyone?- At the festival.
Marching with the crowd.
The life of a man
Burn it in the fire
The life of an insect
Throw it into the fire
When you realize
The world is dark
Life is just a dream
Lose yourself
Burn it! Throw the cart into the fire!
No!
Don't be stingy, fool!
No!
They're suspicious.
Move!
Burn it!
Make room!- Here we go!
No, don't!
Dance!
That's enough. Let's pack it up.
But, boss, there's more.
Don't be greedy.
There's no point taking more than we can carry.
You two carry kan each.
I'll carry With the two women, that's more.
What? I can carry kan too.
I'll carry kan.
Hurry UP!
It's such a shame to leave that gold.
Go back?
Where are you going?
No more.
What are you looking for?
Help!
Boss, help us!
If you want to live, pick up your load.
Follow me!
Matashichi!
Hurry up! We can cross the mountain overnight.
It's hard. I'd rather be dead.
Then die.
What?
Boss!
Calm down!
Don't stand up!
Listen! I'll run and distract them. Escape while you can.
Hey!
We're done for! Let's run!
Farewell!
Did you say something?
I'm not worth it.
Leave me and go!
This is the end.
If we get caught, they'll kill us.
Not if we don't have any gold.
We'll turn them in.
You're right. Maybe we'll even get a reward.
Idiot!
They'll shoot us if we're not careful.
I'm sure Yamana's increasing the patrols at the Hayakawa border.
We can report them there.
Princess!
Your Highness! Hayakawa!
Are you joking? We got them and their gold long ago.
Go home, fools.
Let's drink up!
Look carefully!
You won't see gold pieces again!
Wait.
I'd rather see Princess Yuki!
She's a sight for sore eyes.
To think she'll be beheaded tomorrow...
Stay back!
Just a glance.
Let me through!
Tadokoro here to identify them.
Hyoe Tadokoro!
What happened to you?
Where did you get that scar?
You've changed.
Naturally.
Tell me what happened.
We're on opposite sides, but we're true friends.
Ff ends'?
Then why did you let me survive the shame of my defeat?
To defeat an enemy yet let him live may seem kind,
but it's cruel.
Look at me. Look!
My lord shamed me before everyone.
See the scar left by the relentless beating?
Curse you!
Fool!
So this is the great Hyoe Tadokoro?
What you make of another's kindness is up to you.
As is the lord, so is the retainer.
To punish you so for losing to an enemy...
Even I would not dare such a thing.
I'm the princess! it's me!
That's enough!
I appreciate your loyalty, but this is it.
I want to die with dignity.
Your Highness, your servant Rokurota cannot apologize enough.
You endured so much, and it was all in vain.
You're wrong, Rokurota.
I have enjoyed the journey.
The happiness of these days
I would have never known living in the castle.
I've seen people as they are, without pretense.
I've seen their beauty...
and their ugliness...
with my own eyes.
Rokurota, I thank you.
I can now die without regret.
Your Highness!
Rokurota.
That Fire Festival was wonderful.
That song has stayed with me.
The life of a man
Burn it in the fire
The life of an insect
Throw it into the fire
When you realize
The world is dark
Life is just a dream
Lose yourself
The life of a man
Burn it in the fire
Let's burn it!
Turn the horses around!
Turn them around, I said!
He's mad!
Get them!
Hurry, Rokurota! Take the princess!
Let gm!
She is a great leader. Serve her well.
Hyoe!
Don't die in vain! If you wish, follow us!
Come!
Very well!
Forgive this traitor!
Damn.
When I got to Hayakawa with the gold,
I imagined I'd be so happy.
We're lucky to have our heads.
Let's stay friends.
We risked death together.
We'll stay friends back in the village.
Stray horses.
Gold!
This is all mine.
What? Give me one of them.
I found them first.
You're greedy.
You said we should split everything fifty-fifty.
That was then. This is now!
You shithead!
You.
Are you from the Akizuki clan?
No, we're just peasants.
I don't get it. Peasants with all this gold?
Arrest them!
Let's stay friends in heaven too.
Matashichi! Tahei!
Look up!
What? it's me.
No wonder.
Even I didn't recognize you.
Your armor becomes you.
Rokurota Makabe.
You look even more handsome.
You don't recognize your Princess Yuki?
The mute. The mute girl.
Matashichi.
Tahei.
You two went through a lot for us.
However, that gold is indispensable funds to restore Akizuki.
Not I, not even the princess, can take it.
I hope you will be satisfied with this.
Here.
Split it fairly.
No fighting.
