The familiar logo WARNER BROS. PRESENTS COMES UP.
After a beat, it is consumed by FIRE.
It becomes AN AMERICAN FLAG, BURNING in the street.
1 EXT. U.S. EMBASSY (TEHRAN) - MORNING 1
Effigies of Jimmy Carter and the deposed Shah -- crowds
chanting “Magbar Carter! Magbar Ahmrika!” Fists in the
air.
SUPERIMPOSE: TEHRAN - NOVEMBER 4, 1979
YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN -- about 2/3 men and 1/3 women, some
with flak jackets; about half the young women wear full
chador. Many wear plastic bibs with photographs of
Ayatollah Khomeini.
PASTED TO ROOSEVELT GATE: photographs of STUDENTS who
were killed under the deposed Shah of Iran’s regime.
Signs in English: “U.S.A. RETURN THE SHAH” -- “JUSTICE
FOR MURDER.” A few IRANIAN POLICE attend -- more as
bystanders than peacekeepers.
A MAN frantically stabs an EFFIGY of the SHAH.
An IRANIAN STUDENT films the scene with a Super 8 camera.
2 EXT. EMBASSY GROUNDS - MORNING 2
From INSIDE THE EMBASSY GATES we can hear the noise of
the protest. There are three primary buildings on
campus: the CHANCERY, the embassy’s main building, THE
AMBASSADOR’S RESIDENCE, and the CONSULATE.
We can see that the compound is securitized: sand-filled
traps and steel bars on the windows of the consulate.
3 INT. U.S. EMBASSY - CONSULATE OFFICE - MORNING 3
Now, we see the POV THROUGH those steel bars.
Standing on a chair looking at the protest outside the
gate, is BOB ANDERS, late 40s-50s, a consular officer.
(CONTINUED)
BOB ANDERS
Carnival’s bigger today.
MARK LIJEK, 29, a consular officer, joins Anders at the
window.
4 EXT. ROOSEVELT GATE - MORNING 4
Then, in a famous piece of archive footage, something
simple happens. A YOUNG MAN IN A SWEATER climbs the gate
and makes it to the other side.
And now, we see the REVERSE of that famous shot. This
isn’t archive footage anymore.
We’re looking at the POV of TOM AHERN, 48, the CIA
station chief here.
5 INT. MARINE GUARD POST - MORNING 5
From a pillbox on the embassy campus, SGT. ROCKY
SICKMANN, a young MARINE, can also see the protestors
break across the lawn.
MARINE SGT. SICKMANN
(into his radio)
... Fort Apache is breached -- *
please advise --
6 EXT. ROOSEVELT GATE - MORNING 6
The PROTEST in front of the gate is getting rowdier --
its energy and numbers swelling.
A group of STUDENTS -- these more brisk, organized, all
bearded and dressed in flak jackets -- push their way to
the front of the protest --
WOMEN raise a banner. It’s a signal.
As if on cue, the IRANIAN POLICE move from the gates. A
WOMAN removes a large pair of bolt cutters from
underneath her chador -- hands them to a BEARDED STUDENT
-- who gets to work on the CHAINS holding the gate
closed --
When one YOUNG MAN wearing a green military field jacket
raises his fist, we can see that he has a concealed
PISTOL in his clothes.
More STUDENTS climbing the wall -- dropping the 12 feet
to the other side, one after another.
ARGO - Final 2.
3 CONTINUED: 3
7 INT. MARINE GUARD POST - MORNING 7
MARINE SGT. SICKMANN
THEY’RE COMING OVER THE WALLS --
8 EXT. ROOSEVELT GATE - MORNING 8
But a moment later no more climbing is required, because
the GATE CHAIN IS CUT and protestors FLOOD through the
embassy gates, a human dam breaking --
9 INT. CHANCERY OFFICE - MORNING 9
Mounting chaos in here, the nerve center of the embassy.
Everyone on a different phone. It’s like an emergency
room where the patient is the whole building.
ANN SWIFT, 31, Deputy Political Officer, has the phone by
her ear -- trying to hear reports from D.C.
ANN SWIFT
There are hundreds of people out
there --
(looks out)
No, thousands... There are *
thousands -- *
10 IN THE CONSULATE OFFICE - MORNING 10
Mark Lijek and Bob Anders look out windows, nervous, but
not like the Iranian VISA APPLICANTS who are close to
panic.
BOB ANDERS
Are these supposed to be *
bulletproof?
MARK LIJEK
Well, they’ve never been tested.
11 INT. CHANCERY (MARINE POST ONE) - MORNING 11
Six MARINES watch images from closed-circuit television
cameras on chunky 1970’s monitors. Crowds of protestors
from every part of the embassy campus.
AL GOLACINSKI, 30, chief of security for the embassy,
shouts into a radio.

BOB ANDERS
(on the phone)
Can we get some fucking police
please?
14 INT. MARINE POST ONE - MORNING 14
One by one, the security monitors are going black -- or
smashed. The Marines stare.
15 EXT. TALEGHANI AVE. - MORNING 15
An IRANIAN POLICE CAPTAIN smokes a cigarette, watching
the mayhem, impassive.
16 INT. MARINE POST ONE - MORNING 16
MARINES are putting on armor, gas masks, riot gear. AL
GOLACINSKI goes down the line reminding them of protocol.
AL GOLACINSKI
Don’t shoot. You don’t want to be *
the sonofabitch who started a war -
-
CUT TO: *
AL GOLACINSKI *
They need an hour to burn the
classified -- Hold.
(beat, stern)
You shoot one person, they’ll kill
every one of us in here.

PROTESTORS, now on the embassy grounds, carry banners.
ARGO - Final 4.
11 CONTINUED: 11

PROTESTORS
La ilaha ilallah --
A WOMAN IN A CHADOR uses her own radio.
Some of them ring around the building, holding hands and
chanting. Some carry AUTOMATIC WEAPONS openly.
18 INT. MARINE POST ONE - MORNING 18
AL GOLACINSKI
(into walkie)
Tear gas as last resort ONLY -- I
repeat, only if your life is under
threat!
19 INT. HALLWAY - MORNING 19
Gallegos and Sickmann hear Golacinski’s admonition, but
PUMP TEAR GAS out a window onto protestors below despite
it. One cannister after another.
20 INT. CONSULATE OFFICE - MORNING 20 *
Now the five in the consulate are joined by LEE SCHATZ, *
32, an agricultural attache. *
JOE STAFFORD
-- We’re not going out in this --

The SOUNDS OF MARINES barking at one another over the
radio.
21 OMITTED 21
22 INT. HALLWAY - MORNING 22
They look out a small WINDOW to see a MOB outside.
AL GOLACINSKI

23 INT. CHANCERY OFFICE - MORNING 23
FRED KUPKE, 34, communications officer, is shouting at

Just everything. Don’t sort it --
ANN SWIFT
(on the phone)
-- NONE, there are no police --
ZERO --
24 EXT. CHANCERY - MORNING 24
Al Golacinski steps out onto the steps and immediately
there is shouting, and a protestor puts a GUN to his head
-- blindfolds him -- PUSHING AL’S head to the ground...
25 INT. CONSULATE OFFICE - MORNING 25 *
CORA LIJEK
-- Second floor -- anyone who can
hear this -- we need help --
As we MOVE DOWN the line of desks, JOE STAFFORD is also
on a radio repeating the same in FARSI --
Others PACK things.
26 INT. THE HALLWAY - INTO THE VAULT - MORNING 26
MARINES and STAFFERS -- including TOM AHERN -- RUN down
the hall, pushing a cart of items to secure. They reach
the security locker -- code the door -- and enter the
locker, heading to the INCINERATOR to begin destroying
classified material --
27 EXT. CHANCERY - MORNING 27 *
Golacinski HELD UP TO THE DOOR -- GUN TO HIS HEAD. He
starts to panic.
ARGO - Final 6.

THOUSANDS are now on the grounds of the embassy and they
continue to swarm through the gates.
The student with the SUPER 8 continues to film it all.
Also filming, a NEWS PHOTOGRAPHER with a 16 mm camera.
Smoking cannisters of TEAR GAS, people hurling them.
A protestor lights a paper on fire to ward off the sting
of the gas --
30 INT. CHANCERY OFFICE - MORNING 30

Then... screams. The lights have gone out. The power
has been cut.
31 IN THE VAULT - MORNING 31
AHERN destroys the cryptography keys -- box-sized hard
drives -- while BILL DAUGHERTY, 33, tosses stacks of
papers into an electrical furnace.
ARGO - Final 7.
27 CONTINUED: 27
(CONTINUED)
BILL DAUGHERTY
Well, Tom. You wanted to see the

The furnace makes a LOUD CHUNK and stops. They both hold
their looks for a beat.

Are you kidding me?
AHERN
Get the shredder.

38 INT. CONSULATE STAIRWELL - MORNING 38
The twenty VISA-SEEKING IRANIANS pass our guys and run
down the stairs out onto the street and disperse outside.
Behind them, the FIVE CONSULATE EMPLOYEES we saw head

KATHY STAFFORD, and BOB ANDERS. They get to the bottom
of the stairs.
39 INT. CHANCERY OFFICE - MORNING 39
The students, guns drawn, burst into the Chancery Office,

It’s done. They’re in.
She puts down the phone. *
40 EXT. BIST METRI STREET - MORNING 40
The It’s quiet -- the sound of the protest on the other *
side of the roof and the embassy campus is distant. Just
the empty street.
On the ground: discarded banners from the protest,
fliers and newspapers.
We see something that looks like BLOOD on the street.
ARGO - Final 9.
36 CONTINUED: 36
(CONTINUED)
They walk west. They’re hurrying but taking care not to
run. The five can hear the gunfire and shouting in
Farsi. They walk up the street, away from the sounds of
the protest, instinctively grouping together. Cora looks
back.
BOB ANDERS
Keep going.
41-45 OMITTED 41-45
46 INT. STATE DEPARTMENT HALL - SEVENTH FLOOR - NIGHT 46
Halfway around the world, hell has broken loose here,
too. BATES and MALICK, 30s, State Department mid-level
aides. A cascade of voices and energy -- a reverberation
from the embassy siege -- the building exploding into a
crisis center.
BATES
These fucks can hit us, we
can’t hit back?
MALICK
Mossadeq. We did it to
them first.
BATES
You think the Russians would put
up with this? They’d fucking
invade --
ROBERT PENDER, 40s, joins them heading down the hall.
They’ve all gotten the same call to get to the
Secretary’s office. PETER GENCO, late 20s, behind.
MALICK
What did you expect? We
helped a guy torture and deball
an entire population --
PENDER
(turning behind him)
Schafer! Schafer!
BRICE
At least 60. Could be a hundred.
GENCO
(catching up to them)
You still haven’t found Schafer?
PENDER
(to Genco)
No, I was screaming his name
‘cause I was fucking him.
